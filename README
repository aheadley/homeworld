Homeworld Source Release - README

Please see license.txt for distrution restrictions, namely a RDN (Relic 
Developer Network) account <http://www.relic.com/rdn/> is required to 
download this source code. Unfortunately, as you can see from that link 
the RDN seems to be defunct. Rather than let the source code get lost 
because of legal dumbness I'm posting it here in the hope that Relic either 
fixes RDN or doesn't care enough to make me take it down.
